    """
    Compute the dominance regions of two nodes based on their speeds on a MultiDiGraph.

    This function calculates which nodes in the graph are reached faster by either node1 or node2,
    given their respective speeds. It uses the shortest path lengths from each node to every other node
    in the graph (assuming uniform edge weights). A node is assigned to the region of the node that reaches
    it first (dominance region), or marked as contested if both reach it at the same time. An advantage index
    is computed as the difference in distances from the two source nodes.

    Parameters:
        node1 (int): The first source node.
        node2 (int): The second source node.
        speed1 (int): The speed associated with node1 (higher means faster).
        speed2 (int): The speed associated with node2.
        G (nx.MultiDiGraph): The directed multigraph where distances are computed (assumes unit weight for edges).
        debug (bool): A flag for enabling debug mode. No debug prints are included by default.

    Returns:
        Tuple containing:
          - List[int]: Nodes reached faster by node2.
          - List[int]: Nodes reached faster by node1.

    The function calculates the shortest path(s) using Dijkstra's algorithm. If a valid path is found,
    it returns the node at the specified step index along the shortest path. If `step` is None, the entire
    shortest path is returned. If no path is found or the source node does not exist, a warning is logged
    and None is returned.

    Parameters:
        graph (Union[nx.Graph, nx.MultiDiGraph]): The input graph.
        source_node (Any): The starting node.
        target (Union[Any, Iterable[Any]]): The target node or an iterable of target nodes.
        step (Optional[int]): The step index along the shortest path to return.
                              If None, the entire path is returned. Defaults to 1.

    Returns:
        Optional[Union[Any, List[Any]]]:
            - The node at the specified step along the shortest path if step is provided.
            - The full path as a list if step is None.
            - None if no valid path exists.
